Upon selecting a category, the app displays a list of meals, and selecting a meal shows detailed ingredients and instructions. 

# Features

Meal List: Upon selecting a category, the app fetches and displays a list of meals within that category.
Meal Detail: Provides detailed information about a selected meal, including a list of ingredients.
