# RecipeReady

RecipeReady is an iOS app developed using Swift, SwiftUI, and the Async/Await pattern. 
The app interacts with an API to fetch a list of recipe categories. 
Upon selecting a category, the app displays a list of meals, and selecting a meal shows detailed ingredients and instructions. 

# Features
Category List: Fetches and displays a list of recipe categories from an external API.
Meal List: Upon selecting a category, the app fetches and displays a list of meals within that category.
Meal Detail: Provides detailed information about a selected meal, including a list of ingredients.
